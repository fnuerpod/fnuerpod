Hello there, profile viewer! :wave:

I'm a 20 y/o student who writes code in their spare time. I have experience in the following languages:
- NodeJS
- Luau (ROBLOX)
- PHP
- Python

I also have experience with device configuration automation using Ansible.

# :bulb: Highlights
- I'm one of four system administrators, as well as a full-stack developer, for a small ROBLOX game development studio called [Breadcrumbs Development](https://github.com/bcrms).
- I wrote a replacement for [ClickDetectors](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ClickDetector) in ROBLOX called ClickPoint to alleviate issues with moving clickable items being unclickable. Check it out [here](https://github.com/fnuerpod/ClickPoint).
- I used to write backend and frontend infrastructure for a small Minecraft server called ActionMC. You can see the source code for the main website, which provided user authentication and allow-listing, on [this repository](https://github.com/fnuerpod/actionmc-site-go).
- I made Sky+HD remotes interoperable with Sky Q set-top-boxes using simple IR translation to the Sky Q Web API. You can see more information on how this was done, and try it yourself, by checking out [this repository](https://github.com/fnuerpod/skyhd-remote-skyq).
  
I have many other projects that I've done in the past (and future), and they may not all be listed here! Please browse around to get a feel for what I do.
